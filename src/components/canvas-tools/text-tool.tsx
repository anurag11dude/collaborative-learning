/*
 * This comment to be removed once we're done with development of the
 * initial clipboard functionality. For our first work we have some working
 * definitions and assumptions. The assumptions are numbered.
 *
 * 1. For now, we are not concerned with drag-and-drop. Only copy, paste, and
 * at the tool-level, delete. (If desired, cut is always something that can
 * be composed by a copy-delete.)
 *
 * Selection can be at either the tool-level or at a primitive level, inside
 * a tool. For example, one might click on an area of the page that contains
 * a text-tool. If so, that particular text-tool will be selected. Previously
 * selected tools are unselected. We talk about primitive selections, later.
 *
 * 2. When a tool is selected, (at the moment, the only tool is the text-tool)
 * we visually indicate it is selected, by rendering with a pink background.
 * This rendering will be finalized when we know exactly how we want it to look.
 *
 * A tool maybe be in various clipboard-related selection states -- it may be:
 *
 *    *  not selected,
 *    *  singly selected, or
 *    *  one (of two or more) selected tools.
 *
 * 3. For now, we only support single selection which means at any one time,
 * either no tool or only 1 tool may be selected -- in other words there will
 * either be 1 tool with a pink background; or none.
 *
 * A parallel notion in this model is the idea of the "active" tool. There
 * can only be zero or 1 active tools at any one time.  The active tool is the
 * tool that has the keyboard focus, or contains another sub-component that
 * has the keyboard focus. In other words, it's the tool getting keyboard
 * input and the copy and paste events.
 *
 * Tools in read-only canvas can only be selected, and may not be active. When
 * a tool is selected in an read/write canvas, it is, for now, the only selected
 * tool and is also the only active tool.
 *
 * So, for now, we need not implement a list of selected tools and, instead
 * implement the idea of a single "selectedTile". It needs to be owned by a
 * container of the tool so it needed to be at the canvas, workspace, document,
 * or ui level. Since we don't think the selection state is anything that would
 * be seen by other users (say, in 4-up), nor saved in the database, we have
 * wedged it into the ui model. If those assumptions change, this will likely
 * mean this state (and other stuff) will need to be moved from the ui model
 * and into a more apropos object.
 *
 * 4. Ergo, single selection is implemented in the ui model, in a property called
 * "selectedTile" which is either the id of a toolTile that can be set with
 * "setSelectedTile" or "clearSelectedTile". No selection is indidcated when
 * the selectedTile is unknown.
 *
 * 5. Selection behavior is implemented like this:
 *
 *    * At launch, nothing is selected.
 *    * Any shift of focus will cause the new target tool's tile to become
 *      selected. Since only one can be selected, previously selected ones should
 *      no longer render w/ pink background.
 *
