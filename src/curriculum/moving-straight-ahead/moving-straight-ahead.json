For example, you might have removed (or subtracted) the same number of coins on both sides of the equation. To better understand how to maintain equality, let’s look first at numerical statements. \n\n.   The equation 85 = 70 + 15 states that the quantities 85 and 70 + 15 are equal. \n\nWhat do you have to do to maintain equality if you:\n  • subtract 15 from the left-hand side of the original equation?\n  • add 10 to the right-hand side of the original equation??\n  • divide the left-hand side of the original equation by 5??\n  • multiply the right-hand side of the original equation by 4?\n  \nThe picture below shows a situation from Problem 3.1."
